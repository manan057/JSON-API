# WERD

1. Install all the dependancies
2. Run the `yarn start:dev` command

## Explaintion

- I created an express server so there isn't a lot of boiler plate
- I chose to read in json data and fs because it's easy to read and parse json data
- I was planning to use lodash but it's not too complicated so getting away with using the native functions was easy enough
- Since I am using a static file the chances for breakage are low and we know the data we expect from the database for example
